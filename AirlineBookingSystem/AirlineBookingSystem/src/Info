Build an Airline Ticket Booking System to manage flight details, customer bookings, and ticket pricing.

Classes:
Flight: Contains flightId, destination, departureTime, availableSeats, ticketPrice.
Customer: Contains customerId, customerName, contactNumber.
Booking: Handles ticket bookings with bookingId, flightId, customerId, and numTickets.

Features:
Add, update, or cancel flight schedules.
Book tickets for available flights and ensure seat availability.
Calculate total ticket cost and generate receipts.
Display all flights with available seats and booking history.


Note: Implement a booking system that checks seat availability and computes total ticket cost based on the
number of seats booked. Use exception handling and file handling and necessary classes wherever required
